        <h1>Voicemail</h1>
        <p><i>Go <a href="/">back to the index</a> or <a href="mailto:ryan@beepboop.systems">send me an email</a>.</i></p>
        <p>If you're reading this page, you've just reached my voicemail. Here are some overall guidelines regarding my voicemail behavior:
        <ul>
            <li>If, after dialing you immediately hear my voicemail, then my phone is off. The most expeditious method of contact is now email.</li>
            <li>If, after a repeated dialing tone, you go to voicemail, there are two cases:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The call is urgent.</b> Call again to break through the do-not-disturb barrier.</li>
                <li><b>The call is <i>not</i> urgent.</b> Send me an email with a summary of what you would've said in your voicemail.
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><b>In general:</b> I don't check my voicemail, but I do check my email. If you want to send me a voicemail, send me an email with a summary of your message.</p>
