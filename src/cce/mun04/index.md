## Summary

In response to the collapse of the Derna and Abu Mansour dams on 10 and 11 September 2023, the General Assembly:

- establishes a working group of industry experts to oversee the inspection and, if necessary, repair, of dams and other water bearing structures.

## Resolution Text (*as proposed*)

Noting with concern the events of 10 and 11 September 2023, in which the Derna and Abu Mansour dams within the State of Libya failed catastrophically, allowing water in excess of 30 million cubic meters to quickly enter the Derna district,

Expressing grave concern due to the Libyan National Army and their active denial of reporters and rescue personnel entry into the city of Derna to aid in rescue operations,

Condemning the previous administration of dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and his historical neglect for the local Libyan infrastructure, in addition to willfully ignoring evidence of dilapidation of local critical infrastructure,

Alarmed by the fact that an institutionalized culture of ignorance regarding safety protocols and problems within organizations and governments operating and regulating water-bearing structures has become prevalent and has been found to be the root cause for many disasters directly arising due to the failure and lack of maintenance of major water bearing structures,

Further noting that institutionalized ignorance of safety protocols, problems, and needed repairs causes a lack of resources, funding, oversight, and attention regarding the enforcement and enactment of said protocols and the execution of necessary repairs,

Taking note of the widespread damage caused by the failure of both dams, including the deaths of approximately 19,000 people, and the irreplaceable loss of many homes, business, and other cultural assets and institutions, in addition to the collapse of four bridges, and the washing out of five central routes into the city of Derna,

Guided by the fact that this dam collapse is not the first instance of any such event, making the regulation, maintenance, and repair of dams and other water-bearing structures an utmost priority to the international community,

Further noting with regret that since the inception of the United Nations, 130,980 casualties have occurred as a direct result of accidents and failures of water-bearing structures in member countries of the United Nations,

The General Assembly hereby:

Applauds specifically the efforts of fellow delegations representing the Arab Republic of Egypt, People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, Republic of Italy, Republic of France, Republic of Tunisia, Federal Republic of Germany, State of Qatar, Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Republic of Malta, in addition to the efforts of the member states of the European Union, for their resources and support in response to the crisis in the State of Libya;

Creates a new fund designated for usage only in the repair of dams and other water bearing structures in cases of emergency, imminent disaster, or other essential maintenance, whose total value shall not exceed 40 million USD, and shall be made to be greater than or equal to the value of 20 million USD at each beginning of the United Nations’ fiscal year, January 1;

Initiates the creation of a new working group whose duty is to oversee the distribution of funds within the aforementioned fund, ensure compliant usage of aforementioned funds, approve regulation of water-bearing structure maintenance and standards, and to promote safe practices regarding water bearing structures, and whose eleven (11) members are to be appointed or dismissed by a special vote of the General Assembly at or near the start of each General Assembly session;

Urges domain-specific international stakeholders, national regulators, and agencies to advise and support the newly-formed working group on regulation and rulemaking regarding the safety parameters and design constraints of water-bearing structures;

Asks for a revitalization of safety process and protocols for water-bearing structures across the world, including the testing of old procedure and the reimplementation and restructuring of regulation in light of current issues, including worsening climate and other civil factors;

Requests the temporary reallocation of humanitarian and peacekeeping forces to the State of Libya, in coordination with the Libyan Presidential Council, the Office of the Libyan Health Minister, the Libyan Health Ministry, and the municipality of the city of Derna, for a period of time not to exceed 18 months from the inception of the crisis, as declared by Libyan Presidential Council;

Calls upon the Secretary-General, in accordance with the UN Goals for Sustainable Development, in consultation with other relevant parties, including Member States of the United Nations and infrastructure builders and maintainers, to put these measures into effect by 1 February 2024.
