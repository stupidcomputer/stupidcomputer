    :alt: a picture of my Conn 8D horn

I own an unlacquered Conn 8D. I'm not sure if it's an Elkhart horn or a Abilene horn. (`What is this? <https://www.hornmatters.com/2010/12/the-vintage-conn-8d/>`_)
I definitely don't think it's an Eastlake; from what I've been told about this horn it wouldn't fit that description.
As for the `bell <conn_bell.jpg>`_, it only says "Conn 8D, USA" and nothing else, which doesn't fit the description of either an Elkhart or an Abilene.
