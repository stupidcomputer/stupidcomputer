If you're reading this page, you've just reached my voicemail. Here are some overall guidelines regarding my voicemail behavior:

- If, after dialing you immediately hear my voicemail, then my phone is off. The most expeditious method of contact is now email.
- If, after a repeated dialing tone, you go to voicemail, there are two cases:
  - The call is urgent. Call again to break through the do-not-disturb barrier.
  - The call is not urgent. Send me an email with a summary of what you would've said in your voicemail.

In general: I don't check my voicemail, but I do check my email. If you want to send me a voicemail, send me an email with a summary of your message.
