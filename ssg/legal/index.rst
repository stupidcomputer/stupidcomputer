.. _CCPA compliance:

*CCPA compliance*

Pursuant to the `California Civil Code, div. 3, part. 4, title 1.81.5 ("The Californica Consumer Privacy Act of 2018"), 1798.40 <https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.140>`_, beepboop.systems fails the 1798.140(d) test -- that is, beepboop.systems is *not* a business:

  d. “Business” means:

    1. A sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or other legal entity that is organized or operated for the profit or financial benefit of its shareholders or other owners, that collects consumers’ personal information, or on the behalf of which such information is collected and that alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumers’ personal information, that does business in the State of California, and that satisfies one or more of the following thresholds:

beepboop.systems fails being a "sole proprietorship, partnership, [...], or other legal entity that is organized or operated for the profit or financial benefit of its shareholders", because it's run by one person.

Reading on:

      a. As of January 1 of the calendar year, had annual gross revenues in excess of twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) in the preceding calendar year, as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185.

      b. Alone or in combination, annually buys, sells, or shares the personal information of 100,000 or more consumers or households.

      c. Derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling or sharing consumers’ personal information.

I'm a person, and my behavior fails all three tests.

The only remaining relevant prevision of the 1798.140(d) that I *could* satisfy is this:

    4. A person that does business in California, that is not covered by paragraph (1), (2), or (3), and that voluntarily certifies to the California Privacy Protection Agency that it is in compliance with, and agrees to be bound by, this title.

I don't do business in California, even though I am not covered by 1798.140(a-c).
I also haven't voluntarily certified to the California Privacy Protection agency anything, because I haven't agreed to be bound by the title.
Thus, because beepboop.systems is not a business, the CCPA does not apply to beepboop.systems.

You're more than welcome to request erasure via the privacy policy above, though.

.. _GDPR compliance:

*GDPR compliance*

Persuant to `Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliment <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R0679-20160504>`_, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, beepboop.systems is *not* subject to its provisions because it fails the Chapter 1, Article 2.2c test:

  2. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:

    [...]

    c. by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;

beepboop.systems is hosted as a hobby, which qualifies under the "purely personal" language.

You're more than welcome to request erasure via the privacy policy above, though.
