Hi there.
I'm an amateur `computer programmer <programming/>`_, systems designer, `musician <music/>`_, and `mock legislator <cce/>`_, and this is my website.
Here you'll find various materials related to all of those things, as well as some other odds and ends.

I'm available on github at `stupidcomputer <https://github.com/stupidcomputer>`_ (in addition to my presence on `my Gitea instance <https://git.beepboop.systems>`_) and email via the address `ryan@beepboop.systems <mailto:ryan@beepboop.systems>`_.
I also have a `resume <./resume.pdf>`_ if you're interested.
You can also see `more ways to contact me </contact.html>`_.
