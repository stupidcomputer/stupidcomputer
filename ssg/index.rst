Ryan Marina's website
=====================

Hi there.
I'm an amateur `computer programmer <programming/>`_, systems designer, `musician <music/>`_, and `mock legislator <cce/>`_, and this is my website.
Here you'll find various materials related to all of those things, as well as some other odds and ends.
On this server, I run my own `gitea <https://git.beepboop.systems>`_, a private code forge.

I'm available on github at `stupidcomputer <https://github.com/stupidcomputer>`_ and email via the address `ryan@beepboop.systems <mailto:ryan@beepboop.systems>`_.
Begrudgingly, I'm available on Discord as ``hmmstmachine``.
If you need another form of contact, email me and I'll give it to you.

To see previous revisions of the site, click `here </changelog.html>`_.
